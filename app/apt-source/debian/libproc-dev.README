README for libproc-dev
======================

This README is for people who want to use the libraries for their own
programs.  If you just want to use procps tools you don't need to use this
and you can probably remove libproc-dev too.

It is generally a bad idea to dynamically link to libproc.  The API changes
a fair bit and I cannot guarantee that it will stay the same between minor
versions (though it will stay the same between Debian versions).  I've now
re-included the libproc.a file so use that.
