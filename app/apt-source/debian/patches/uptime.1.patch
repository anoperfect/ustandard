 .BR w (1).

+System load averages is the average number of processes that are either
+in a runnable or uninterruptable state.  A process in a runnable state is
+either using the CPU or waiting to use the CPU. A process in
+uninterruptable state is waiting for some I/O access, eg waiting for
+disk.  The averages are taken over the three time intervals.
+Load averages are not normalized for the number of CPUs in a system, so
+a load average of 1 means a single CPU system is loaded all the time
+while on a 4 CPU system it means it was idle 75% of the time.
